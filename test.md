**Feedback on Relately**

I just spent some time using your app and wanted to share my initial impressions with you.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarity of the "Start Session" Button:**  
   On the homepage, I found the "Start Session" button a bit unclear. I wasn’t entirely sure what it was supposed to do. It might help to provide a brief explanation or a tooltip to guide first-time users.

2. **Guidance for First-Time Users:**  
   When I first launched the app, I wasn’t quite sure what to do. The app prompted me with, "What do you want to talk about?" but I felt uncertain about what options were available. Some initial guidelines or suggestions would be really helpful here to orient new users.

3. **Camera Usage Notification:**  
   While testing the app, I was sitting on my couch and suddenly noticed the app commenting on my facial expression. This caught me off guard since I wasn’t aware the camera was actively being used. To enhance user comfort, it would be great if there was a small indicator or notification (like a recording icon) that alerts users when the camera is being used during sessions.

4. **Session Flow and Closure:**  
   During the session, the conversation felt like it was dragging on at times, almost as if the app was stretching out the interaction even when everything seemed to be covered. Some directional suggestions or prompts could help guide the conversation more effectively. Additionally, a “done speaking” button would be useful for signaling when I’m ready to move on or conclude the session.

5. **Privacy Concerns:**  
   This might be because I’m familiar with the development process and know the creator personally, but I felt a bit concerned about privacy. However, I imagine that once the app gains more users and I become just one of many, this concern would diminish. Still, reinforcing a sense of privacy could be important for early users.

**What I Liked:**

1. **Courses Section:**  
   The "Courses" section is well-designed. It’s immediately clear that this section is focused on helping me improve specific skills, like negotiation.

2. **Visual Design:**  
   The large circle in the middle of the interface feels very "AI-like" and adds a futuristic touch. The overall design of the app is both professional and visually appealing.

3. **Conversation Experience:**  
   The voice interaction with the assistant is phenomenal—it's a really futuristic experience. It almost feels like talking to a therapist, which I found both intriguing and engaging.

4. **Real-Time Feedback:**  
   I appreciate the feedback the AI provides, such as noting when I appeared confused. This feature is a great reminder to be mindful of my facial expressions during sessions.

**Summary:**

Overall, I think the app has amazing potential. With a bit more guidance and some additional feedback indicators, it could become a truly standout product.
