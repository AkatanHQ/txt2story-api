      "detailed_appearance": "The Heart of Aether appears as an ethereal, humanoid figure, standing at an impressive height of around seven feet, giving it an imposing presence. Its body is elegantly sculpted, with a slender yet muscular build that conveys both grace and strength. The skin shimmers with a soft, luminescent glow, reminiscent of light reflecting off a smooth surface of water, shifting colors gently from deep blue to bright white.\n\nThe hair flows like liquid silver, cascading down to the mid-back in a cascade of rippling waves that seem to dance in the air. Strands of hair catch the light, refracting it into tiny prism-like sparkles that trail off like stardust.\n\nFacial features are striking and otherworldly, with high cheekbones and a smooth jawline that gives an almost symmetrical perfection. The eyes are large and captivating, filled with swirling galaxies of blues and purples—an endless depth that draws the gaze in. Instead of pupils, they appear as luminous orbs, reflecting a burst of radiant energy.\n\nThe Heart of Aether is adorned in a flowing robe made of a material that appears to be woven from the very fabric of the cosmos; it shimmers in a spectrum of colors from violet to teal as it catches the light, shifting with every movement. Intricate silver patterns reminiscent of constellations are embroidered into the fabric, lending an air of mystique. The sleeves are long and billowy, tapering at the wrists, while the hem of the robe glides effortlessly just above the ground, leaving a trail of glowing particles in its wake.\n\nIn addition to the robe, a shimmering belt of liquid light sits firmly around its waist, pulsating gently with an inner glow. This luminous accessory seems to channel the immense power of the Heart of Aether itself.\n\nThe entity stands with a regal posture, exuding an aura of confidence and calm. One hand rests gracefully at its side, while the other is raised slightly, as if ready to channel the energy that radiates from within, casting an ambient light that dances around it."
